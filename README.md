# MyAboutMe
Final project that allows the user to create a masonry grid and sliders. Any person can create an account and add images to their sliders and masonry.

This project consists of PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL.
I heard that Github does not allow for live hosting for php pages so this allows me to show the code for the website. 


The website to see it live is below:
